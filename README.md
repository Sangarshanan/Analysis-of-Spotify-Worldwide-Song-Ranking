# Analysis-of-Spotify-s-Worldwide-Daily-Song-Ranking

Spotify is a music, podcast, and video streaming service that was officially launched on 7 October 2008. It is developed by Spotify AB in Stockholm, Sweden. It provides DRM–protected content from record labels and media companies ###

### Data:

### Explanation:

The dataset is contained in only one file. Each row contains a ranking position on a specific day for a song.

For instance, the first 200 rows present the ranking for the 1st of January in Argentina. The following 200 rows will contain the ranking for the 2nd of January in Argentina. The regions are alphabetically sorted.

Be aware that Spotify's data was missing in very few occasions, so do not play with the 200-ish row interval as an offset as it may be misleading. Prefer to read everything and filter by region, date, so that you can be sure to have the required slices of data.

I have analysed the trends in ranking and songs of my favourite artists like Ed sheeran, Camilla cabello, Shakira etc
